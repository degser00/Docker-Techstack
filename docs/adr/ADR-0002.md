# ADR-0002: Split of Concerns for AI Compliance Logging and Observability
Date: 2025-11-05
Status: Accepted
Deciders: Owner

## Context:
- We need compliant handling of AI prompts/responses with **separation of duties**.
- n8n triggers AI calls but should not access full prompt/response logs.
- Observability should measure **operational metrics** without exposing content.
- Single PostgreSQL instance will host **four separate databases** with distinct credentials:
  1) n8n workflow/queue DB  
  2) Business workflows DB  
  3) AI compliance logs DB  
  4) Observability summaries/aux (if needed)

## Decision:
- Introduce a **Proxy** service between n8n and Ollama/OpenWebUI:
  - The Proxy is the **sole writer** of **AI compliance logs** (prompts, responses, metadata) into the **Compliance DB**.
  - n8n has **no read access** to compliance content; it only receives the model’s response.
  - Observability stack (Grafana/Prometheus/Loki) has **read-only access** to **aggregated/metrics views** (no raw content).
  - NocoDB provides **human/audit read-only** access to the Compliance DB for authorized users.
- Enforce least-privilege DB roles:
  - **proxy_rw** → R/W on compliance schema only.
  - **obs_ro** → R/O on metrics views only.
  - **nocodb_ro** → R/O on full compliance schema (auditors/admins).
  - **maint_runner** → delete/archive privileges for retention jobs.
- Retention handled **outside n8n** by a scheduled maintenance job/container:
  - Periodic deletion of rows older than the policy window.
  - Optional export to encrypted cold storage before deletion.

## Consequences:
- ✅ Clear separation: runtime automation (n8n) vs. logging (Proxy) vs. visibility (Observability) vs. audit (NocoDB).
- ✅ Reduced risk of accidental data exposure via dashboards.
- ✅ Auditable access path for sensitive content.
- ⚠️ Additional components (Proxy + Maintenance job) increase operational surface.
- ⚠️ More credentials to manage; must document rotation.

## Scope (Current):
- Confidential-but-queryable logs (admins/auditors via NocoDB).
- Single PostgreSQL instance, four DBs with distinct users/permissions.
- Observability limited to metrics/summaries (no content).

## Workflow (High-Level):
1) **n8n → Proxy → Ollama/OpenWebUI** for model calls.  
2) **Proxy → Compliance DB** writes prompt/response/metadata.  
3) **Observability** reads **metrics views only** for dashboards.  
4) **NocoDB** provides **read-only** human access to compliance contents.  
5) **Maintenance job** enforces retention/archival.

## Observability Interface (non-content)

- The Observability stack (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, Promtail, cAdvisor) ingests **metrics and infrastructure logs only**.
- Observability has **no direct read** of raw AI prompts/responses in compliance tables.
- Database access for Observability is restricted to **`obs_ro`** on **metrics/summary views** only.
- Optional Prometheus **Pushgateway** may be used for operational KPIs; **business records remain in business DBs**.

## Ingress & Exposure

- Only **Grafana** is exposed externally via **Cloudflare Zero Trust**; all other observability services remain **internal-only**.
- n8n and the Proxy expose **Prometheus endpoints** and write **stdout logs**; scraping/collection occurs over internal networks.

## Alternatives Considered:
- Logging directly from n8n: violates separation, expands n8n permissions.
- Observability with full-content access: increases exposure risk and scope.

## Future Extensions (separate ADRs later):
- **High-sensitivity tier**: encryption-at-rest per column, view-level redaction, key management.
- **Automated redaction** (PII/secret scrubbing) at Proxy before persistence.
- **Cold storage** archival (e.g., S3/Blob, Parquet/CSV) with lifecycle policies.
- **Access reviews** and alerting on anomalous queries to compliance tables.
